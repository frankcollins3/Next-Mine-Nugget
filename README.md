# Next-Mine-Nugget
Cannabis App Themed as a Gold Mine.


#### updating mine-nugget-ts:
GraphQL instead of REST (REST was facilitated by ES6 classes that took parameters to execute server hitting methods)
@redux/toolkit instead of UseContext for state.
{Contexts -> Add `RegexBank context`. Add `Promise bank` to handle all/most functions. (App already has `<img src={}/>`
mobile responsive.
interfaces, possibly generics. DynamicUI, and Possibly component-composition
Error Handling

Kind of want to use puppeteer: to scrape leafly data or blog websites, find strain information and add StrainData to the database.

If there aren't the exact object endpoints available to create the object: email or text the holder of the repo and allow them to add to the file.
(This option of allowing someone to fork and clone this app and add data to the databank would have to use .json() so they're not mutating deployed database state)
